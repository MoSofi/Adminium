### Patch Changes

- docs: correct four claims the code does not support
  
  - **Desktop.** `Settings → Desktop` renders exactly three cards (Sign-in,
    Share on local network, App permissions). The install page's update-mode
    table and the backups page's "change the depth or turn it off in Settings →
    Desktop" both pointed at controls that have never existed. Both settings are
    real — `updates.mode` and `autoBackup.{enabled,keep}` in `config.json` — so
    the pages now say where they actually live, that the file is read once at
    launch, and which read-only surfaces (Help → About, Help → Check for
    Updates…) exist instead. Also records how the updater resolves its release
    (the releases list, filtered to `desktop-v*`, never GitHub's repository-wide
    "latest" pointer), the auto-backup schedule, and that `export-zip` is
    portability rather than a backup.
  - **`anatomy/index.md` §11.** "Nothing in the repository sends mail" was false
    end to end: `email.smtp` drives a real nodemailer transport, `email.send` is
    a registered job kind, and password resets, invitations, notifications and
    the template test-send all queue through it. Rewritten to name the absences
    that are real — no provider adapters, no `/settings/email` screen, no outbox
    table — and to correct `smtpConfigured` from "the whole of it" to the
    read-only consequence it is.
  - **`anatomy/packages.md`.** Every row of the per-package table recomputed
    under the convention the page states; 13 of 15 were wrong, several by a whole
    package's worth of files. The page now prints the commands that produce the
    figures and says plainly that nothing in CI holds them.
  - **The axe baseline count.** Dropped rather than refreshed. It is a debt
    counter with no CI tie — the quoted 162 had drifted well past the file — so
    the note points at `packages/ui/a11y-baseline.json` instead.

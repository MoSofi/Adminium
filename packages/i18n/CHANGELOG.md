# @adminium/i18n

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 4091a4f: Evict ICU format failures by recency, and hand out copies of them.

  The bounded ring evicted by insertion order rather than recency. A repeat updated its record in place without moving it, while eviction always took the first key — so the message failing most often was the first to go. One bad message in a render loop, which is the exact case the ring exists to surface, was evicted by 49 unrelated one-off failures before an admin could ever see it in the Translations editor. Repeats now re-insert, so key order is recency order and eviction takes the least recently seen.

  `formatFailures()` also handed out live references into the ring, typed `readonly FormatFailure[]` — which protects the array, not the entries. A held result changed under the caller on the next failure, and a caller could write straight into the ring; `GET /i18n/format-errors` was safe only because it serialises immediately. Entries are now copied and typed `readonly Readonly<FormatFailure>[]`. The copy is what provides the guarantee, since `readonly` is erased at runtime.

  Both paths are covered by tests, which this module previously had none of.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Runtime translation overrides, add-on contracts, and Studio navigation.

  `@adminium/i18n` gains a runtime override layer (`createI18nWithOverrides`, `mergeOverrides`, `rebuildWithOverrides`, `overrideTag`) alongside runtime locale registration (`setRuntimeLocales`, `resetRuntimeLocales`, `availableLocales`) and format-failure reporting. The compiled bundle and the override tree are held separately and merged in userland, with the instance rebuilt on each revision bump rather than the i18next resource store being mutated: i18next 25 cannot delete a key from a bundle, so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in" — the most common admin operation.

  `@adminium/add-on-contracts` is a new package carrying the add-on slot and provider-contract registries, their types, and conformance suites. `@adminium/manifest` grows the matching vocabulary — `addOnManifestSchema`, `manifestKindSchema`, `isAddOnManifest`, `addOnIssues` and the `AddOnBlock` type — so an add-on manifest is validated by the same path as an app manifest.

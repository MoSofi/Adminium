### Minor Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Rework the CLI setup wizard's prompts, output, and ending.

  The wizard now has a visual grammar: one continuous vertical rail down the left margin with a glyph per step — `◇` settled, `◆` current, `▲` wants attention. Previously every line printed at column 0, so a seven-step flow read as an undifferentiated transcript with no way to tell decisions from narration. Adds width-correct clipping (styling applied after the clip, since escape codes otherwise measure as visible columns and can be severed mid-sequence), word-boundary wrapping for prose, and a scrolling viewport for long pickers — a frame taller than the terminal cannot be rewound without the redraw eating the lines above it.

  Also lifts the wizard's pre-hidden-table rule into `@adminium/engine` as `isPreHiddenTable`. The Studio hid Adminium's own `adminium_*` store, other tools' migration bookkeeping, and join tables from its first commit, while the CLI wizard was still offering `adminium_users` as a table to build an admin panel over — generation declines to page all three regardless, so that selection could never be honoured. One rule, beside the classifier that assigns the roles, shared by both front doors.

### Patch Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Runtime translation overrides, add-on contracts, and Studio navigation.

  `@adminium/i18n` gains a runtime override layer (`createI18nWithOverrides`, `mergeOverrides`, `rebuildWithOverrides`, `overrideTag`) alongside runtime locale registration (`setRuntimeLocales`, `resetRuntimeLocales`, `availableLocales`) and format-failure reporting. The compiled bundle and the override tree are held separately and merged in userland, with the instance rebuilt on each revision bump rather than the i18next resource store being mutated: i18next 25 cannot delete a key from a bundle, so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in" — the most common admin operation.

  `@adminium/add-on-contracts` is a new package carrying the add-on slot and provider-contract registries, their types, and conformance suites. `@adminium/manifest` grows the matching vocabulary — `addOnManifestSchema`, `manifestKindSchema`, `isAddOnManifest`, `addOnIssues` and the `AddOnBlock` type — so an add-on manifest is validated by the same path as an app manifest.

### Patch Changes

- ef1c300: Let admins create and edit pages from Studio, and give every screen one gutter.
  
  Pages are now a first-class thing an admin can make. Studio gains a pages
  section — create, duplicate, reorder columns, pick an icon, choose a template —
  backed by page lifecycle routes on the server and the page repo and permission
  checks in `@adminium/meta`. Until now a page existed only as something the
  generator emitted from a schema snapshot, so a hand-made page had no way to
  fill its own body.
  
  `@adminium/engine` gains the entry point that makes that possible.
  `generatePages` composes a whole app and picks every template itself;
  `composeRequestedArchetype` composes one page but only for the nine archetypes,
  because it delegates to `buildArchetypeEnvelope` and that returns null for
  anything else. Neither serves an admin who picked `page-crud` for a table by
  hand, which is the most common choice. `recompose` is the missing third door:
  the same classify → candidates → compose prelude, dispatching to
  `buildCrudEnvelope` or `buildArchetypeEnvelope` as the template demands, so the
  server can rebuild a page's body from live schema instead of leaving it empty.
  Templates that are not table-bound — `page-dashboard` composes from a domain,
  and `page-builder`/`page-wizard`/`page-settings` are tool surfaces whose bodies
  the renderers ignore — return `bindable: false` with a null envelope, so the
  caller keeps whatever the page already had rather than blanking it.
  
  The second half is `PageSurface`. Every routed screen used to invent its own
  gutter — `p-6` here, `p-[var(--main-pad)]` there, `p-10` on one wizard, nothing
  at all on the templates that forward straight to `@adminium/widgets` — so the
  padding changed every time you moved between two screens of the same app. Now
  each screen renders exactly one `PageSurface`, which owns the inner main
  section and is the only thing that can set the gutter; the shell's sidebar and
  topbar sit outside it and are unaffected. It takes `standard` (the density-scaled
  `--main-pad`), `none` for templates that draw their own full-bleed chrome, or an
  explicit x/y pair from a page's stored config, with `width: 'content'` as an
  independent knob for screens that are a short stack of controls rather than a
  grid.
  
  Chart and KPI text now has a legibility floor held by a test rather than by
  eye, and the theme control moved out of the header into the account menu as a
  verb-labelled item ("Light mode" / "Dark mode") that keeps its ⌘⇧L shortcut.

### Patch Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Runtime translation overrides, add-on contracts, and Studio navigation.

  `@adminium/i18n` gains a runtime override layer (`createI18nWithOverrides`, `mergeOverrides`, `rebuildWithOverrides`, `overrideTag`) alongside runtime locale registration (`setRuntimeLocales`, `resetRuntimeLocales`, `availableLocales`) and format-failure reporting. The compiled bundle and the override tree are held separately and merged in userland, with the instance rebuilt on each revision bump rather than the i18next resource store being mutated: i18next 25 cannot delete a key from a bundle, so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in" — the most common admin operation.

  `@adminium/add-on-contracts` is a new package carrying the add-on slot and provider-contract registries, their types, and conformance suites. `@adminium/manifest` grows the matching vocabulary — `addOnManifestSchema`, `manifestKindSchema`, `isAddOnManifest`, `addOnIssues` and the `AddOnBlock` type — so an add-on manifest is validated by the same path as an app manifest.

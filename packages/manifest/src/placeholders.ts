/**
 * THE PLACEHOLDER, WRITTEN ONCE: `{{name}}` and `{{name|backup}}`.
 *
 * A placeholder names a value. After a bar it may carry a BACKUP: the words
 * written when the value is not there or is empty — `Thanks, {{first_name|there}}!`
 * reads "Thanks, there!" for a customer with no first name. The backup is
 * plain text up to the closing braces; it holds no braces of its own, and the
 * spaces around it are not part of it. `{{first_name|}}` is a backup of
 * nothing: the placeholder then prints nothing rather than itself.
 *
 * Without a bar nothing changes from before there was one: a value that is
 * there is written (an empty one writes nothing), and a name nothing fills is
 * left exactly as written, so the person who wrote it can see which.
 *
 * The bar was never legal inside a name, so no text stored before this reads
 * differently now.
 *
 * Every reader of the grammar — the email renderer, a rule's own fields, the
 * checks of an app's manifest, the outbox — reads it from here, so they cannot
 * come to disagree about what a placeholder is.

 *
 * - `moves`: from each state, the states a write may move a row to. A move
 *   may ask for something first — child rows, a column's value — and may be
 *   kept for some of the app's roles. A move not listed is refused.
 * - `lock`: while a row is in one of `when`, only `except` (and the state
 *   itself, through a move) may change. Adminium's own columns (totals,
 *   stamps) keep being written by Adminium.
 * - `children`: child tables tied to this row's state. `lock` refuses their
 *   writes while the row is locked; `parentIn` allows them only while the row
 *   is in those states (payments on a sent invoice) — or, apart, `createIn`
 *   for a new child and `changeIn` for a change or a delete of one (a payment
 *   taken only on a live stay, and voided on a cancelled one too); `clearOnCreate` empties
 *   columns of this row when one of them is created (a recorded payment
 *   clears the client's "I've sent it"). `release` opens a locked child a
 *   little while its parent is in some of the lock's states: a change that
 *   only EMPTIES the listed columns (a void invoice's line letting go of the
 *   time it billed, so the time can be billed again), and only in a state no
 *   move leaves. `lockLinked` keeps the
 *   listed columns of the row a child's link points at from changing while
 *   the child points at it (the hours of time on an invoice) — unless the
 *   parent is in a state that releases that link.
 * - `lockedWhenReferencedBy`: this row locks once a row of another table in
 *   one of the states points at it (a terms version once a proposal naming it
 *   is sent).
 * - `noDelete`: rows in these states, or any row with a number
 *   (`"numbered"`), are never deleted — voided instead.
 * - `onlyLater`: date columns that may move later and never earlier.
 * - A move may also wait for the row one of its links points at
 *   (`requires.linked`), for a window on the clock (`requires.time`, read from
 *   moments — see `refs.ts`) and for a value of the settings row
 *   (`requires.setting`).
 * - `strict`: a write naming the state the row already holds is refused
 *   (a ticket let in once), repeating up to four columns of the row.
 * - `late`: a move made inside some time before a moment sets a flag, or is
 *   refused.
 * - `timed`: listed moves Adminium makes by itself once a moment of the row
 *   has passed (a held order expiring).
 * - `effects`: a move that moves the row one of its links points at too, by a
 *   move that table lists (a guest checked out turns the room to cleaning).
 * - `create`: what a new row must meet to be created — the conditions a move
 *   waits for, judged when the row is written (a check-in only for a paid
 *   ticket, on its day).
 * - A timed move may also write fixed values to other columns (`set`).
 *
 * Adding sample data and importing past records are history: they write any
 * state their rows were in.

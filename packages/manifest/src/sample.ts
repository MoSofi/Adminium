 * `adminium.sample/1` — an app's sample data, shipped in its package and named
 * by the manifest's `sampleData.file`.
 *
 * Rows are written in the order the tables are listed, parents first, and
 * removed in reverse. A value is a plain JSON value or one of these directives:
 *
 *   `{"@ref": "<label>"}`      the key of an earlier row with that `@label`
 *                               (or of a labelled starting row of the manifest's
 *                               own `seeds`: see `seedLabelsOf`)
 *   `{"@ago": "PT19M"}`        an ISO-8601 duration before now
 *   `{"@in": "PT20M", "@grid": 15}`   an ISO-8601 duration after now; with
 *                               `@grid`, rounded up to the next time on that
 *                               many minutes' grid of the venue's own clock
 *                               (the first pickup slot at least 20 minutes on)
 *   `{"@day": -1, "@time": "09:30"}`   a wall time in the venue's own zone,
 *                               days from today
 *   `{"@day": 3}`              a date in the venue's own zone
 *   `{"@t": {"en-US": "…"}}`   the adding person's language
 *   `{"@asset": "<label>"}`    a file from `assets`, added to the Files library
 *   `{"@table": "<table>"}`    that table's stored name, for a column that
 *                               holds one (`rules.tableRef`): the name it has
 *                               on this install, whichever app made the table
 *
 * A `@day` may add `"@workdays": true`: its days count Monday to Friday, and
 * day 0 on a weekend is the Monday after — so "today's" busy day is never a
 * Saturday. Or `"@week": true`: its days count from the bundle's anchor day
 * (`weekAnchor`, a weekday) in the week nearest today, so every date keeps
 * the weekday the sample was written for — a weekend stay stays on a
 * weekend, whatever day the sample is added on.
 *
 *   `{"@in": "PT20M", "@slot": "orders"}`   the first open time of that
 *                               table's slot limit at least that far ahead —
 *                               its hours, closures and pauses, on its grid —
 *                               on the next day it opens when today has none
 *
 *   `{"@month": -2, "@dom": 14}`   a date in the venue's own zone: that day of
 *                               the month so many months from this one; with
 *                               `"@time": "10:00"`, a wall time on it
 *
 * `@month` keeps a sample's history in calendar months whatever day it is
 * added on: a figure "this month" or "in May" reads the same on the 3rd as on
 * the 28th. A day past the month's end is its last day, and a day in this
 * month or later that has not come yet is today (at a time not yet come, now):
 * a month's history never runs into the future.
 *
 * A row may carry, beside its `@label`, one ROW directive: `@byClock`
 * `{at, before, around, after}` merges one of three sets of columns into the
 * row, by where its time `at` (a column of the row, or a `@day`/`@time`)
 * falls against the adding moment — more than half an hour before, within
 * half an hour, or later — so a sample day's statuses match the clock it is
 * added at. A set with `"@skip": true` leaves the row out (a payment for a
 * visit that has not happened yet). Or `@byStay` `{from, to, times?, before,
 * during, after}`: by where the adding moment falls against the row's two
 * times — its arrival and its departure (columns of the row, or `@day`s) —
 * before the stay, during it, or after it; a date is read at `times.from` /
 * `times.to` on its day (arriving from 15:00, leaving by 11:00), else at its
 * midnight. So a stay's status (booked, in house, departed) matches the
 * clock it is added at. A row takes one of the two.
 *
 * `"@onlyIfEmpty": true` is for a table that holds one row, the app's own
 * settings: the row is added only when the table has none, and otherwise its
 * `@label` names the row already there — the operator's own settings stay.
 *
 * AN APP'S ROWS FOR AN ADD-ON. An app that names an add-on may ship a second
 * file of the same format with a top-level `addOn`: rows of that add-on's
 * tables (its items, its recipes — never its history), and rows of the app's
 * own tables that link into them, each marked `"own": true`. It is named by
 * the manifest's `sampleData.addOns.<key>.file` and loaded only while the
 * add-on is there. `sampleSectionIssues` checks one.
 *
 * Pure: a format and its checks, no I/O. The server resolves the directives.

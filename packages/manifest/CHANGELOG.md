- b847dfc: **An add-on can own a page in the dashboard, and a row in the sidebar for it.**
  
  Until now an add-on could fill a slot inside somebody else's screen, and nothing
  more: the manifest schema refused `pages` outright, and the five sidebar groups
  were a closed set written out in five places. So a feature large enough to need
  its own screen had to be built into Adminium itself, whatever the plan said.
  
  An add-on's manifest may now declare `pages` — each one a module in its own
  bundle, with a title, an icon and where it belongs in the rail — and
  `navGroups`, if it would rather bring a group of its own than join one. A page
  that names no group lands in **Library**. Several pages of one add-on can sit
  together under a heading the add-on brought with it, and that heading carries
  its own label, so nothing in the engine has to know the words.
  
  The page itself runs as a page, not as an iframe with a border: the dashboard
  publishes its React, its UI kit, its router, its query client, its translations
  and its own helpers to the bundle, so the add-on renders inside the shell with
  one React, one cache and one history. The module is served over an
  authenticated route and pinned to the fingerprint recorded when the add-on was
  installed — a package edited on disk afterwards is refused rather than run.
  
  Every way this can fail says which one it is. Not installed, switched off, no
  page at that address, the package does not ship the file it names, the module
  would not load, the page itself threw: six sentences, six different answers, and
  a blank screen is not one of them.

- 8fb86bf: The contract registry gains a fourth entry: `document-render@1` (bought
  2026-09-02), with two implementations in the same wave — `invoices` and `barcode-labels`
  — which is what gate asks of a new contract.
  
  It is the first contract an add-on uses to hand Adminium **bytes**. Every other
  one describes a conversation with a service: a carrier quotes and books, a
  personalizer prices an option, a transport delivers a message. This one takes a
  `DocumentSubject` — values only, no database handle, no connection, no clock —
  and returns rendered files. The subject is the only door, and it is frozen into
  the register row at render time, so a document stays what it was after the row
  it was drawn from is edited or deleted.
  
  What the conformance suite (`describeDocumentRenderer`) holds an implementer to:
  
  - every kind it names must `describe()`, with `label` and `help` as **records in
    all eight compiled locales** — never a key. There is no add-on bundle in the
    dashboard to resolve one against, so a `{key, fallback}` label would ship its
    English fallback to eight languages.
  - rendering the same subject twice is **byte-identical**. A renderer that stamps
    a clock or a random id fails here rather than on somebody's invoice.
  - money arrives as **integer minor units** and percentages as **basis points**;
    the arithmetic law itself belongs to the implementer, not the contract.
  - HTML output carries no `<script>`; PDF output is `%PDF-1.4` with a byte-exact
    xref table, asserted by parsing it back over a subject containing `é ß ø €` —
    and a kind declaring `coverage: 'ascii'` must REFUSE those glyphs rather than
    drop them silently.
  - a locale the implementer cannot draw refuses with `LATIN_ONLY` and names what
    it `dropped`; a missing required slot refuses `MISSING_SLOT`; an unknown kind
    refuses `UNSUPPORTED_KIND`.
  
  `@adminium/manifest` moves with it: an add-on may now declare
  `provides: [{contract: 'document-render', version: 1}]` and be installed, a
  setting may carry `help` beside its `label`, and `dashboard` joins the reserved
  key set — it is the host an add-on attaching to `*` is mounted under on a
  deployment with no host app, so an app of that name would make the attachment
  ambiguous.
  
  **No new slots.** `document-render@1` is drawn through the two ids that already
  existed, `record.actions` and `settings.add-on.panel`.

- 4d68dc9: Add-ons can now be installed, attached to a host, switched off per host, and
  uninstalled — and `manifests.manage` became a real permission.
  
  Plan 32 got a verified package onto local disk and stopped there. This is the
  first half of what happens next: the meta surface, the install planner, and the
  routes. It is deliberately not the whole runtime — see the end for what still
  refuses.
  
  **`adminium_manifests` already existed.** It has shipped since migration 0006
  with no repo, no writer and zero rows, and three planning documents recorded it
  as absent. So migration 0020 ALTERs rather than creates, adding `kind`, and
  `licenseKeyEncrypted` — a column plan 17 defers by name — is left in place and
  read by nothing rather than dropped, because it is empty and dropping a column
  is the one thing a migration cannot take back.
  
  **Attachments are a join table.** The wave's plan originally recommended two manifest rows keyed
  `(manifest_key, attached_to)` for an add-on attached to two hosts; that recommendation was withdrawn and the
  join table ratified. Three costs argue against it, and the third only became visible once the table turned
  out to be shipped: two rows mean two copies of the manifest document, which an upgrade must then rewrite
  atomically or leave one host on an older version; the credential FK becomes ambiguous, since a DHL API key
  belongs to the add-on rather than to one of its attachments, so disconnecting "the other one" either orphans
  a secret or deletes a live one; and it requires dropping and recreating the shipped
  `uq_adminium_manifests_manifest_key` across three dialects, against own "never edit a shipped migration". An
  attachment is a many-to-many fact and now has the table that models one. `disabledAt` lives there rather than
  on the manifest, so an add-on can be live on one host and off on another — which a single flag could not
  represent.
  
  **Credentials get their own key, not the DSN's.** `deriveKey`'s `info` parameter
  exists to keep purposes apart, and these are genuinely different: a DSN opens
  the operator's own database, an add-on credential opens a third party's API on
  their behalf. Sharing a key would mean a leak of either is a leak of both, and
  rotating one to contain an incident would silently invalidate the other. The
  ciphertext column is called `payload`, which none of the log-redaction patterns
  matched — `payload` is now redacted, along with `refreshToken` and `accessToken`.
  That will redact some innocent job payloads too; an un-redacted credential in a
  log costs more than a debugging session does.
  
  **`planInstall` is a document, not a step.** The consent dialog is the security
  surface, so what it shows had to be computable without side effects and
  renderable even when the answer is no — a refusal is data, not an exception that
  leaves the dialog with nothing to draw. The case that makes it non-trivial is
  the foreign key pointing *out*: two of the three shipped add-ons that declare
  tables reference tables they do not own (`design-studio.job_id → jobs`,
  `personalizer.product_id → products` and `order_line_id → order_lines`). Those
  belong to the host, so a reference resolves as internal, host, or unresolved,
  and only the third stops an install. A planner that only emitted DDL would find
  that at `CREATE TABLE`, having already created the other tables — on MySQL,
  which has no transactional DDL, permanently.
  
  **`manifests.manage` is grantable, in the same change that landed its first
  enforcement point** — which is the rule its own reserved list documents. It went
  to `operations` rather than `workspace`: installing an add-on runs its server half
  in this process, which is closer to starting a job than to changing a setting,
  exists precisely to stop it riding on `settings.manage`. The reserved set had four
  hard-coded copies rather than the two that were expected, and one of them is
  production code — `RESERVED_GRANTS` in the dashboard's `rolesApi.ts`, which the
  dashboard cannot import from `@adminium/meta`, so nothing detects drift and a key
  left there is silently dropped from the matrix with no error and no failing test.
  
  Applying a plan that needs new tables lands in the same release — see the
  add-on schema changeset — so an add-on whose tables the host database already
  has and one that brings its own both install completely.
  
  Uninstall deletes the meta rows and the package directory and touches the data
  source not at all, so every table an add-on brought stays with its rows; the
  reply says so, rather than leaving the UI to assert it. And 26's acceptance #8 —
  "a composeServer-level test that fails if a route is exported but unregistered"
  — finally has one. Nothing enforced it before: the M10 regression test checks a
  hard-coded URL list, audit coverage only sees routes that are registered, and
  the OpenAPI check reads the built spec. All three are blind to exactly the gap
  that shipped green twice.

- 1d7c7b4: Runtime translation overrides, add-on contracts, and Studio navigation.

  `@adminium/i18n` gains a runtime override layer (`createI18nWithOverrides`, `mergeOverrides`, `rebuildWithOverrides`, `overrideTag`) alongside runtime locale registration (`setRuntimeLocales`, `resetRuntimeLocales`, `availableLocales`) and format-failure reporting. The compiled bundle and the override tree are held separately and merged in userland, with the instance rebuilt on each revision bump rather than the i18next resource store being mutated: i18next 25 cannot delete a key from a bundle, so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in" — the most common admin operation.

  `@adminium/add-on-contracts` is a new package carrying the add-on slot and provider-contract registries, their types, and conformance suites. `@adminium/manifest` grows the matching vocabulary — `addOnManifestSchema`, `manifestKindSchema`, `isAddOnManifest`, `addOnIssues` and the `AddOnBlock` type — so an add-on manifest is validated by the same path as an app manifest.

plan was never published, so those citations were dead ends for every reader but
their author, and they were reworded on 2026-09-17. No entry's substance

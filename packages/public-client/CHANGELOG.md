# @adminium/public-client

## 0.3.0-rc.4

### Patch Changes

- ab31a89: **Apps can ask for public access for their guests, and staff sign in on the app's own address.**
  
  At install you see — and may untick — what an app's guests will be able to do (allowing it needs
  **Manage API keys**): which tables
  they read or write, through which methods and fields. Adminium makes the app its own browser
  key and endpoints; the key cannot be widened to unsafe methods. Availability endpoints answer
  "free" or "full" per time and nothing more; two guests booking the last seats at once get one
  confirmation and one "full". A guest finds their own booking by its code and mobile number (the
  number compared by its digits, however it was typed). Public replies give times as instants, so
  a guest in another time zone sees the venue's time. `@adminium/public-client` gains
  `availability()`, `fromTenantLocal()` and the new error codes (`PUBLIC_SLOT_FULL`,
  `PUBLIC_SLOT_BUSY`, `PUBLIC_TOO_LATE`, `APP_DISABLED`, `SURFACE_OFF`).
  
  On a domain mapped to an app's staff screens, the sign-in page is the venue's: its name and the
  app's, and "Opening <app>…" while the app loads. A first visit in a right-to-left language is laid
  out right to left before anyone signs in.

## 0.3.0-rc.3

### Patch Changes

- ae41762: **The public client can replace, delete and batch-write rows, and `list()` reads every response shape.**
  
  - `replace(ref, id, values)` sends a PUT. Every column the key may write must be included.
  - `remove(ref, id)` deletes one row.
  - `batch(ref, rows)` writes 1 to 500 rows in one transaction and returns `{ count }`.
  
  `list()` returns `{ data, cursor }` whether the endpoint answers wrapped, as a bare array (the
  next cursor comes from `X-Next-Cursor`) or as a single row, and it makes no extra request to
  find out which. `PublicAction` gains `replace`, `delete` and `batch`, and a ref's config may
  carry `response.shape`. These need a server from 0.3.0.

### Patch Changes

- a94f776: Add the browser client for the scoped public API: a dependency-free
  `createPublicClient` that returns `null` when its build-time env is absent, so a
  demo build falls back to seed data structurally rather than in a catch, plus the
  tenant-timezone helpers every connected app needs to avoid rendering a
  15:00 London appointment at 16:00 in a Berlin browser.

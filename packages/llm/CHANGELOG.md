### Patch Changes

- c451e7d: **A page assistant that drafts in the page's own format, and never saves.**
  
  The pages that build documents — Email templates and Report builder — gain an
  **Ask** button in the header. It opens an assistant
  that already knows what that page holds: its documents, the format they are
  written in, your branding, and the tables your role can read. Describe what you
  need and it drafts it, showing its work: every tool it ran, every table it
  touched, and what the draft would be.
  
  **It never writes.** The model's last move is a draft. Every button that would
  change something is locked until you turn actions on for that session, needs the
  same permission the page's own Save needs, and asks once more before it runs.
  What it saves is a draft — an email template disabled, a report with status
  `draft` — and every write leaves an audit row naming the session that proposed
  it.
  
  **Reading rows is opt-in.** By default it works from your documents and schema
  alone. An administrator can let it read rows your role can read — masked, at
  most 50 per request, and listed under *Sources read* on every result. That
  switch is not carried by an exported bundle: importing somebody else's
  configuration can never turn it on for you.
  
  The permission is seeded to Super Admin and Admin only, and a role that may
  draft but not save is the ordinary case: it can look, draft, preview, and put a
  draft straight onto an editor's screen, with the writing buttons locked and a
  sentence saying why.
  
  Settings → AI names the assistant and holds the row-data switch. It needs the
  same AI provider schema enrichment uses; there is no copy-paste path here,
  because a conversation is many round trips.

### Patch Changes

- 2dffc12: Stop a dead icon name costing a generated app its first paint, and put 64
  untranslated keys into the locale bundles.
  
  - `kanban-square` is not a lucide icon — it was renamed to `square-kanban`. It
    was emitted as `nav.icon` by the page generator, so any generated app with a
    workflow-shaped table fetched the entire ~137 KB icon catalogue on first paint
    to discover the name was dead, then drew the neutral `File` fallback anyway.
    A second instance, `bar-chart-3`, was found by the new gate.
  - `gen-icon-core.mjs` already computed the list of declared-but-unknown icon
    names and discarded it, printing only a count. It now fails in both `--check`
    and write mode, naming the offending file and the canonical rename.
  - `LUCIDE_ICON_NAMES` is now a real export. `allowedIcons` was documented as
    fed by it, that symbol existed nowhere, and nothing supplied the value — so
    the unknown-icon warning and the `table` fallback never fired and a model
    could store any hallucinated icon string on a table.
  - 64 `t()` keys existed in no locale bundle and rendered a hardcoded English
    default in all 8 locales, 56 of them the Settings → Languages & translations
    page itself — the one page whose keys the in-product translation editor
    cannot reach, because it refuses any key absent from the compiled bundle.
    All 8 bundles now carry them, translated rather than copied from English.

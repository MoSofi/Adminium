## 0.2.2-rc.0

### Patch Changes

- 00cd08f: Refresh the dependency tree, including four runtime majors.
  
  Runtime dependencies that reach consumers: `i18next` 25 → 26, `pino` 9 → 10, `croner` 9 → 10 and `fastify-type-provider-zod` 6 → 7, alongside `fastify` 5.12, `kysely` 0.29, `pg` 8.23, `mysql2` 3.23, `argon2` 0.45 and the `@fastify/*` plugins. Build tooling moved too — `dependency-cruiser` 18, `@changesets/cli` 3, `@types/better-sqlite3` 9 (now matching the `better-sqlite3` 13 it describes).
  
  `i18next` 26 is the one worth knowing about, because the runtime override layer is built directly on 25's semantics: the reason overrides are applied by rebuilding the instance on each revision bump, rather than mutating the resource store, is that i18next cannot delete a key from a bundle — so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in", which is the most common admin operation. That design still holds under 26, and the 171 `@adminium/i18n` tests pass unchanged. `argon2` 0.45 remains Node-API (`napi_versions: [8]`), so the packaging notes about native addons are unaffected.
  
  This release also carries `builtinLocaleDir`, exported from `@adminium/ui`'s theme barrel, which landed earlier without a changeset of its own.
  
  Several things were deliberately held back rather than swept, each for a measured reason, and are recorded in `.github/dependabot.yml` so they stop arriving weekly: `lucide-react` 1.x (+16.1 KiB gz on the dashboard entry chunk, and it drops the brand icons), the `@radix-ui/*` set (+4.8 KiB gz together), `happy-dom` 20 (breaks a desktop About test that passes on 18), and the `vite` 8 cluster (no stable `electron-vite` accepts it). The entry chunk came out of the sweep 0.6 KiB *smaller* than before, so the size ratchet clicked down with it.
- aabc4e1: Diagnose transaction-pooling (PgBouncer) Postgres endpoints. Adminium sets its
  session timeouts in the startup packet, which Neon `-pooler` hosts and Supabase's
  port-6543 pooler reject with a bare `08P01: unsupported startup parameter in
  options: statement_timeout`. That failure now maps to `UNSUPPORTED` with a hint
  naming the fix — use the direct/unpooled connection string — and the connect
  wizard shows the adapter's hint instead of the generic "verify the DSN" copy.
  
  Adapter remediation hints are now persisted alongside the driver message
  (`adminium_connections.last_error_hint`, migration `0013`), so a failing
  connection still explains itself on the Hub after a reload.
- ef1c300: Let admins create and edit pages from Studio, and give every screen one gutter.
  
  Pages are now a first-class thing an admin can make. Studio gains a pages
  section — create, duplicate, reorder columns, pick an icon, choose a template —
  backed by page lifecycle routes on the server and the page repo and permission
  checks in `@adminium/meta`. Until now a page existed only as something the
  generator emitted from a schema snapshot, so a hand-made page had no way to
  fill its own body.
  
  `@adminium/engine` gains the entry point that makes that possible.
  `generatePages` composes a whole app and picks every template itself;
  `composeRequestedArchetype` composes one page but only for the nine archetypes,
  because it delegates to `buildArchetypeEnvelope` and that returns null for
  anything else. Neither serves an admin who picked `page-crud` for a table by
  hand, which is the most common choice. `recompose` is the missing third door:
  the same classify → candidates → compose prelude, dispatching to
  `buildCrudEnvelope` or `buildArchetypeEnvelope` as the template demands, so the
  server can rebuild a page's body from live schema instead of leaving it empty.
  Templates that are not table-bound — `page-dashboard` composes from a domain,
  and `page-builder`/`page-wizard`/`page-settings` are tool surfaces whose bodies
  the renderers ignore — return `bindable: false` with a null envelope, so the
  caller keeps whatever the page already had rather than blanking it.
  
  The second half is `PageSurface`. Every routed screen used to invent its own
  gutter — `p-6` here, `p-[var(--main-pad)]` there, `p-10` on one wizard, nothing
  at all on the templates that forward straight to `@adminium/widgets` — so the
  padding changed every time you moved between two screens of the same app. Now
  each screen renders exactly one `PageSurface`, which owns the inner main
  section and is the only thing that can set the gutter; the shell's sidebar and
  topbar sit outside it and are unaffected. It takes `standard` (the density-scaled
  `--main-pad`), `none` for templates that draw their own full-bleed chrome, or an
  explicit x/y pair from a page's stored config, with `width: 'content'` as an
  independent knob for screens that are a short stack of controls rather than a
  grid.
  
  Chart and KPI text now has a legibility floor held by a test rather than by
  eye, and the theme control moved out of the header into the account menu as a
  verb-labelled item ("Light mode" / "Dark mode") that keeps its ⌘⇧L shortcut.

### Minor Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Parse Postgres `int8` as a JS number on the meta pool.

  `createPostgresMetaDb` documented that its pool must decode int8 as a number but shipped nothing that could satisfy it, so callers either forgot — every `ts` column arrived as a string and `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` failed against its own reply schema — or reached for a process-global `pg.types.setTypeParser`, which masked the callers that had. `postgresInt8AsNumber(pgModule)` is now exported next to the contract it satisfies: `new Pool({ …, types: postgresInt8AsNumber(pg) })`.

  Scoped to the one pool deliberately. The META schema pins `ts` to epoch milliseconds and `bigint` to values under 2^53, but the server reads the user's own tables through the same `pg` module and their `bigint` ids carry no such promise — a global parser there would be a data-integrity bug in waiting. Structurally typed over the module, so `@adminium/meta` still declares no driver dependency.

### Patch Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Runtime translation overrides, add-on contracts, and Studio navigation.

  `@adminium/i18n` gains a runtime override layer (`createI18nWithOverrides`, `mergeOverrides`, `rebuildWithOverrides`, `overrideTag`) alongside runtime locale registration (`setRuntimeLocales`, `resetRuntimeLocales`, `availableLocales`) and format-failure reporting. The compiled bundle and the override tree are held separately and merged in userland, with the instance rebuilt on each revision bump rather than the i18next resource store being mutated: i18next 25 cannot delete a key from a bundle, so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in" — the most common admin operation.

  `@adminium/add-on-contracts` is a new package carrying the add-on slot and provider-contract registries, their types, and conformance suites. `@adminium/manifest` grows the matching vocabulary — `addOnManifestSchema`, `manifestKindSchema`, `isAddOnManifest`, `addOnIssues` and the `AddOnBlock` type — so an add-on manifest is validated by the same path as an app manifest.

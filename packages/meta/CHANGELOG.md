# @adminium/meta

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Parse Postgres `int8` as a JS number on the meta pool.

  `createPostgresMetaDb` documented that its pool must decode int8 as a number but shipped nothing that could satisfy it, so callers either forgot — every `ts` column arrived as a string and `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` failed against its own reply schema — or reached for a process-global `pg.types.setTypeParser`, which masked the callers that had. `postgresInt8AsNumber(pgModule)` is now exported next to the contract it satisfies: `new Pool({ …, types: postgresInt8AsNumber(pg) })`.

  Scoped to the one pool deliberately. The META schema pins `ts` to epoch milliseconds and `bigint` to values under 2^53, but the server reads the user's own tables through the same `pg` module and their `bigint` ids carry no such promise — a global parser there would be a data-integrity bug in waiting. Structurally typed over the module, so `@adminium/meta` still declares no driver dependency.

### Patch Changes

- 1d7c7b4: Runtime translation overrides, add-on contracts, and Studio navigation.

  `@adminium/i18n` gains a runtime override layer (`createI18nWithOverrides`, `mergeOverrides`, `rebuildWithOverrides`, `overrideTag`) alongside runtime locale registration (`setRuntimeLocales`, `resetRuntimeLocales`, `availableLocales`) and format-failure reporting. The compiled bundle and the override tree are held separately and merged in userland, with the instance rebuilt on each revision bump rather than the i18next resource store being mutated: i18next 25 cannot delete a key from a bundle, so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in" — the most common admin operation.

  `@adminium/add-on-contracts` is a new package carrying the add-on slot and provider-contract registries, their types, and conformance suites. `@adminium/manifest` grows the matching vocabulary — `addOnManifestSchema`, `manifestKindSchema`, `isAddOnManifest`, `addOnIssues` and the `AddOnBlock` type — so an add-on manifest is validated by the same path as an app manifest.

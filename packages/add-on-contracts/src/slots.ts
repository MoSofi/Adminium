/**
 * Slot registry v1 — CLOSED (24-marketplace-wave-4.md §5.4, eleven slots).
 *
 * A slot is a named place in a host surface, its payload, and its fill rule.
 * The registry is closed for the same reason the widget-id vocabulary is: an
 * open-ended extension point cannot be reviewed, translated, or kept working
 * across host versions. Adding a slot is a spec change, never a pull request
 * against an app.
 *
 * There is NO compatibility signal for this vocabulary, so do not look for one.
 * A slot carries no `version` field, unlike ContractDefinition (`version: 1`,
 * checked by hasContractVersion), and this package cannot version on its own
 * cadence either: the repo's changeset config declares `fixed: [["@adminium/*"]]`,
 * so every workspace moves together and the package version says nothing about
 * which slots a release speaks. Evolving a slot after release therefore needs a
 * real `version` field on the contract pattern — an earlier revision of this
 * comment claimed a package bump was the mechanism, and it never was.
 *
 * Every slot here is filled by something built in wave 4. A slot nobody fills
 * is a guess about a future add-on, which is why an earlier draft's twelfth
 * (`job.timeline.entries`) is absent.

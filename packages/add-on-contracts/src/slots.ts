 * Slot registry v1 — CLOSED (24-marketplace-wave-4.md §5.4; eleven slots, plus
 * one bought on 2026-08-28 and named at the end of the list).
 *
 * A slot is a named place in a host surface, its payload, and its fill rule.
 * The registry is closed for the same reason the widget-id vocabulary is: an
 * open-ended extension point cannot be reviewed, translated, or kept working
 * across host versions. Adding a slot is a spec change, never a pull request
 * against an app.
 *
 * There is NO compatibility signal for this vocabulary, so do not look for one.
 * A slot carries no `version` field, unlike ContractDefinition (`version: 1`,
 * checked by hasContractVersion), and this package cannot version on its own
 * cadence either: the repo's changeset config declares `fixed: [["@adminium/*"]]`,
 * so every workspace moves together and the package version says nothing about
 * which slots a release speaks. Evolving a slot after release therefore needs a
 * real `version` field on the contract pattern — an earlier revision of this
 * comment claimed a package bump was the mechanism, and it never was.
 *
 * Every slot in the original eleven is filled by something built in wave 4. A
 * slot nobody fills is a guess about a future add-on, which is why an earlier
 * draft's twelfth (`job.timeline.entries`) is absent.
 *
 * THAT RULE SURVIVED A PURCHASE RATHER THAN BEING WAIVED BY ONE. `record.actions`
 * arrives unfilled and is not a guess: it carries seven exhibits with a file and
 * a line each, and the entry itself sets out the difference at length so a
 * reader does not have to take the distinction on trust. If a second slot ever
 * lands here on weaker evidence than that, this paragraph is the thing it
 * should be measured against.

     * THE TWELFTH, BOUGHT ON 2026-08-28 (31-add-on-candidates.md O1).
     *
     * ── IT IS NOT THE TWELFTH THIS FILE'S HEADER REFUSES ────────────────────
     *
     * The header says a slot nobody fills is a guess about a future add-on, and
     * names `job.timeline.entries` as the guess that was cut. A reader arriving
     * here and finding a slot with no fill in this release is owed the
     * difference, because on the face of it this is the same thing.
     *
     * A GUESS HAS NO EXHIBITS. `job.timeline.entries` was somebody's idea of
     * what an add-on might one day want; nothing in any repo asked for it. This
     * id arrives carrying seven, each a real screen in a shipped app with a
     * file and a line against it, gathered by five independent surveys that
     * were not looking for a slot — they were looking for what the apps lie
     * about — and then held to an adversarial pass. They are written down in
     * 31 Appendix A.1, which is the artifact this entry cites and which exists
     * so the purchase can be audited rather than taken on trust:
     *
     *   1. the per-record document renders (invoice, folio, receipt, recall
     *      letter, .ics) across five apps
     *   2. the certificate render moment
     *   3. every transactional send-this-record moment — twelve hosts
     *   4. the wallet-pass render moment
     *   5. click-to-call / log-a-call on a deal
     *   6. the post-resolution satisfaction action
     *   7. attach-a-room to a session record
     *
     * 25 §8.2 declined this same shape and said what would change its mind:
     * two independent implementations' worth of evidence. That is the bar this
     * cleared, and the ruling is recorded rather than inferred.
     *
     * ── WHAT IT IS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * One opening, on the screen where somebody is already looking at ONE
     * record, to do a thing to it. Every exhibit above is that sentence. The
     * eleven ids before it could not carry any of them: `order.line.actions`
     * is a line inside an order rather than a record, `order.dispatch.actions`
     * is the dispatch end of an outbound order specifically, and
     * `record.editor.panel` is a PANEL inside the generated dashboard's editor
     * — a different host, a different verb, and no example app has one.
     *
     * ── `both`, AND WHY NOT `staff` ─────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * The dossier's own title says "staff/admin", and five of its seven
     * exhibits are staff screens. Two are not: the certificate sheet is the
     * STUDENT's own page (`learning-platform/src/screens/Certificate.tsx`
     * opens "the student's completion sheet") and the wallet pass is the
     * ticket-holder's. Ruling the id `staff` would have put the two exhibits
     * everyone actually wants to demo outside the thing bought to carry them,
     * and 31 §A.3 already records "neither the 11 nor A.1 covers a customer
     * surface" as an open gap — which is the same observation from the other
     * end.
     *
     * There is nothing in the payload that a customer looking at their own
     * record makes dishonest: it is a record and a way to write back to it,
     * and who is reading changes what the HOST mounts, not what the slot is.
     * `nav.add-on.routes` is `both` for the same reason.
     *
     * ── THE ONE THING A READER SHOULD HOLD AGAINST IT ───────────────────────
     *
     * It ships in wave 6 with NO FILL. Its first consumer is `docs-paperwork`,
     * which is wave 5 and unbuilt, and the wave-6 add-on that could have
     * filled it honestly turned out not to need it: `holiday-calendars`'
     * working-day counts are derived live from the merged calendar, so a
     * "recompute this request" action would have been an invented reason to
     * touch the slot rather than a thing an operator wants. Inventing one to
     * make this entry look filled is precisely the dishonesty the registry is
     * closed to prevent, so it is not filled, and this comment says so.

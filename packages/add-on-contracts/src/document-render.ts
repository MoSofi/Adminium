/**
 * `document-render@1` (34-invoices-add-on.md §4, Appendices A and B) — the
 * fourth contract, and the first one Adminium ITSELF consumes.
 *
 * It provides KINDS OF DOCUMENT an add-on can describe — an outline of slots,
 * every label written in all eight compiled locales — and render to BYTES. The
 * consumer is the engine document pipeline (profiles, the record trigger, the
 * `document.render` job, the `/documents` routes), which is the first
 * production read of `runtime.providers`: a provider is selected by the
 * profile's add-on key, never by `resolveProvider`'s lowest-key choice.
 *
 * ── THE SUBJECT IS THE ONLY DOOR (31 A.1's rule, applied to a contract) ─────
 *
 * A provider receives VALUES and returns BYTES. It gets no database handle, no
 * network, and — the one that gets forgotten — no clock: `subject.now` is the
 * only time it may read, which is what makes 25 D12's byte-identical claim
 * testable rather than aspirational. `describeDocumentRenderer` renders twice
 * and compares every byte.
 *
 * ── BYTES, NOT A `FileRef` ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * {@link RenderedDocument.bytes} is a `Uint8Array`. `FileRef.bytes`
 * (`common.ts:14,22`) is a COUNT, and a provider that returned one would be
 * claiming it had already stored the file — which it cannot do, having no file
 * seam. The engine stores what comes back; the provider never does.
 *
 * ── PER-KIND `formats` AND `coverage`, AND WHY THEY ARE ON THE KIND ────────
 *
 * "HTML always, PDF always" is NOT this contract's law. `label-sheet` is
 * `['pdf']` with nothing to say in HTML; `receipt` draws on 80 mm paper no A4
 * consumer wants. And a writer that draws Helvetica's WinAnsi repertoire
 * cannot draw Arabic or Han — so a kind declares the glyphs it covers and
 * REFUSES what it cannot draw, typed, as {@link DocumentError} `LATIN_ONLY`
 * carrying the offending glyphs. A silent drop would ship an invoice with a
 * customer's name missing letters (34 D6, O11, O12).
 *
 * ── THE `body` CHANNEL IS A ONE-WAY DOOR, AND IT IS OPEN ───────────────────
 *
 * §4.3 ships this module verbatim into eighteen repos before the first
 * provider exists, so a field added later is a second eighteen-repo ceremony
 * plus a second contract release. {@link RenderInput.body} is therefore here in
 * the first release. Its shape is O28(a2) — ruled 2026-09-07 as **D54**: an
 * opaque `Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>` whose schema the PROVIDER owns. A
 * typed union would have frozen the redesigned comp's 27 block kinds
 * (`Invoice Builder.dc.html` blockOrder:1114, custom:1266-1272) into a
 * contract eighteen repos vendor, making every later block a contract release.
 *
 * A starter is a TEMPLATE PRESET, not a kind (O28(b), D54) — which is why
 * `kinds()` stays at three for the invoices provider while the surface offers
 * twelve starters over eight titles.

 * **[DEP-33 — a departure from Appendix B, forced and minimal.]** Appendix B

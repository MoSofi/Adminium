Parse Postgres `int8` as a JS number on the meta pool.

`createPostgresMetaDb` documented that its pool must decode int8 as a number but shipped nothing that could satisfy it, so callers either forgot — every `ts` column arrived as a string and `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` failed against its own reply schema — or reached for a process-global `pg.types.setTypeParser`, which masked the callers that had. `postgresInt8AsNumber(pgModule)` is now exported next to the contract it satisfies: `new Pool({ …, types: postgresInt8AsNumber(pg) })`.

Scoped to the one pool deliberately. The META schema pins `ts` to epoch milliseconds and `bigint` to values under 2^53, but the server reads the user's own tables through the same `pg` module and their `bigint` ids carry no such promise — a global parser there would be a data-integrity bug in waiting. Structurally typed over the module, so `@adminium/meta` still declares no driver dependency.

Refresh the dependency tree, including four runtime majors.

Runtime dependencies that reach consumers: `i18next` 25 → 26, `pino` 9 → 10, `croner` 9 → 10 and `fastify-type-provider-zod` 6 → 7, alongside `fastify` 5.12, `kysely` 0.29, `pg` 8.23, `mysql2` 3.23, `argon2` 0.45 and the `@fastify/*` plugins. Build tooling moved too — `dependency-cruiser` 18, `@changesets/cli` 3, `@types/better-sqlite3` 9 (now matching the `better-sqlite3` 13 it describes).

`i18next` 26 is the one worth knowing about, because the runtime override layer is built directly on 25's semantics: the reason overrides are applied by rebuilding the instance on each revision bump, rather than mutating the resource store, is that i18next cannot delete a key from a bundle — so the store has no way to express "reset this key to the built-in", which is the most common admin operation. That design still holds under 26, and the 171 `@adminium/i18n` tests pass unchanged. `argon2` 0.45 remains Node-API (`napi_versions: [8]`), so the packaging notes about native addons are unaffected.

This release also carries `builtinLocaleDir`, exported from `@adminium/ui`'s theme barrel, which landed earlier without a changeset of its own.

Several things were deliberately held back rather than swept, each for a measured reason, and are recorded in `.github/dependabot.yml` so they stop arriving weekly: `lucide-react` 1.x (+16.1 KiB gz on the dashboard entry chunk, and it drops the brand icons), the `@radix-ui/*` set (+4.8 KiB gz together), `happy-dom` 20 (breaks a desktop About test that passes on 18), and the `vite` 8 cluster (no stable `electron-vite` accepts it). The entry chunk came out of the sweep 0.6 KiB *smaller* than before, so the size ratchet clicked down with it.
